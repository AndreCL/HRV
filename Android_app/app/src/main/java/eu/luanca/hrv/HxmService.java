                                 * some specific devices.  Ordinarily all you would have to do to create the BLuetooth socket
                                 * is use the create call, specifying the UID of the Bluetooth service profile that will be
                                 * used for the connection.     In the case of our application that call would look
                                 * like this:
                                 *                  tmp = device.createRfcommSocketToServiceRecord(MY_UUID);
                                 *
                                 * The problem is, sometimes when you make that call an error will return either from the
                                 * attempt to create the socket, or later when the attempt is made to connect to the socket.
                                 * The error code most often reported is 'Unable to start service discovery For device'.
                                 *
                                 * Obviously this is a problem because you can't create a connection to any device on any
                                 * known UID if the call does not work.
                                 *
                                 * There is a technique that has been used to work around this issue.  It is referred to as
                                 * 'java reflection'.  If you are not familiar and are interested, an Internet search for
                                 * the term will give you lots of interesting reading on the topic.
                                 *
                                 * The important thing for us is that it gives us a means to call directly into the
                                 * Bluetooth rfcomm class/object avoiding whatever problem is present in the current
                                 * Android+Bluetooth+Handset implementation.
                                 *
                                 * Our application creates the connection using this technique as follows:
                                 *
                                 *      Method m = device.getClass().getMethod("createRfcommSocket", new Class[] {int.class});
                             *      tmp = (BluetoothSocket) m.invoke(device, 1);
                                 *
                                 *
                                 * CAUTION:
                                 * The problem with doing this is that there isn't any guarantee that the call we are accessing
                                 * will be there in future versions of the platform.  And if it is there no guarantee that
                                 * it will work in the same manner.  If you look at the current implementation of the rfcomm
                                 * object you will find several places where there is embedded commentary warning developers
                                 * noting that the class is likely to change in the future.
                                 *
                                 * When you build your applications, consider if it is appropriate to restrict the allowed
                                 * platforms to the ones that you have thoroughly tested.  You may also consider an
                                 * implementation that uses both the standard implementation and the workaround implementation
                                 * such that if the documented approach does not work, the workaround is attempted as a
                                 * fall-back.
                                 *
                                 * It is also advisable to make sure that the error reporting mechanism within your application is
                                 * especially robust so that problems that users have that may end up being related to the bluetooth
                                 * issue are quickly isolated.
